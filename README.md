# House-Price-Prediction
🌺🔍 House Price Prediction Project in Python

📊 In this project, I utilized Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and TensorFlow to perform House Price Prediction.

🏠 Understanding the Data: Initially, I loaded and cleaned the dataset, focusing on relevant features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking facilities, and furnishing status.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of features, identify outliers, and visualize relationships between variables using scatter plots, box plots, and distribution plots.

🔍 Data Preprocessing: Handled outliers in the price and area columns, created dummy variables for categorical features, and applied standard scaling to normalize the data.

📈 Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, trained a Linear Regression model using the training data, and evaluated its performance on the testing set.

🎯 Model Evaluation: Calculated metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared score to assess the accuracy and performance of the trained model.

💡 Key Findings: The trained model achieved a high accuracy score, indicating its effectiveness in predicting house prices based on various features.

🚀 Business Implications: This predictive model can assist real estate professionals, homeowners, and buyers in making informed decisions regarding property valuation and investment strategies.

📚 Technologies Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
